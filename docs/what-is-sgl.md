# What is Space Grade Linux?

SGL is a linux distribution built using Yocto, made by passionate
developers who want to contribute to their industry by sharing all of
their experience working in space. The project aims to deliver a core
image with the basic needs for every space mission, while also offering
images with the top well known user space apps such as cFS, F', and
SpaceROS.

## Who's behind the project?

The project is hosted under the [ELISA Project](https://elisa.tech), part of the Linux
Foundation, and is being stewarded under the Space Grade Linux SIG
currently under ELISA's TSC, formed by ELISA members and Space industry
organizations that align with our vision.

## About the SIG

The goal of the group is to advance space technology innovation and
competitiveness by developing a common Linux distribution that can be used
in space applications, ready for the challenges of deep space, often long
lifespan robotic or human-based missions. The nature of space missions brings
many challenges, from development to deployment there are multiple considerations
that need to be considered. Furthermore this group is the initial step towards
creating an ecosystem of supported platforms and a community that benefits
from them, and also from the open source nature of the project.

## How to collaborate / join?

The Space Grade Linux SIG is recruiting members to embark on a development
journey together with the likes of Boeing, NASA, EASA, and the Linux Foundation.

Joining the ELISA discord server, or the SGL  mailing list is the best way to contribute
to the project, itâ€™s as simple as registering your email. The second best way
to collaborate is joining our recurring formation calls, you can find the details
on the calendar link below. We usually publish the meeting agenda ahead of time
on the mailing lists, and have our meetings on Zoom.
